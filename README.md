### Testing Nodes in isolation

Each node can be tested in isolation.
sample script can be found in `tests/scripts/run_node_with_graph.py`

```python
    # this method draws the graph - if you want to visualize the graph,
    draw_graph()
    # use this method, change NodeName value to test different node.
    # NOTE: make sure that the new node is added and helper method is
    test_single_node(NodeName.COLLECTING_INFO, "I want to schedule a meeting with John Doe on 2025-08-01 at 10:00 AM for 1 hour")
```

to test the chatbot in full, use the run_node_
run using `poetry run python tests/scripts/run_chatbot.py`

use
```bash
poetry run python tests/scripts/run_node_with_graph.py
```
